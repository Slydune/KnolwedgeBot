The sociological perspective emphasizes what we “know” to be mental health and illness is socially constructed, which varies by place (i.e., country) , group (i.e., status position) and time (i.e., historically). As such, we attempt to answer three fundamental questions throughout this course: First, what is mental illness? That is, how mental illness is defined and experienced. Second, how do social factors influence the definition of and prevalence of mental illness? Finally, how should society prevent and respond to mental illness? That is, how does society react to those thought to be mentally ill and how is treatment structured. This course examines the sociological theories and research used to answer these three questions.
